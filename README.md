myStatus
========

myStatus is an Android app that provides self-management tools to users
with chronic health conditions. It helps users manage their medications,
stay in touch with their clinicians, and report their status by responding
to surveys. The survey rendering and submission components are based on
[ODK Collect](http://opendatakit.org/use/collect/).

Features
--------

  - Collects user's status information using surveys specified in the
    [XForms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xforms) format. Clinicians can
    also use ODK's [XLSForm](http://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/) tool to
    create surveys.

  - Submits collected data to the clinician via a server running an
    [ODK Aggregate](http://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) instance.

  - Displays history of survey responses to show progress over time.

  - Tracks user's prescriptions and reminds the user to take them.

  - Provides quick-dial buttons for important contacts.
